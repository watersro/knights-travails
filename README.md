# Knights Travails

This a project that is part of The Odin Project. The was wa to build a function that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

This was a challenge, and I did consider skipping it. The key was to break every component down to ensure I understood it, and to keep in mind the relations between each node or 'move', and how they should be represented and traversed
